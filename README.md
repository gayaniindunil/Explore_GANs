This repo containes codes of image generation experiments done to explore generative adversarial networks.

I'm trying to generate images on various datasets with different GAN architectures.

## Topics to understand
 * unconditional GANs 
 * condiotional GANs
 * Face generation with progressive GANS
    * StyleGAN
 * Apply conditional GANs and progressive GANs on other datasets.

Here are some experiments I tried out so far
  1. Face Generation using face images of google nature Images. 
      Here I have used the DCGAN architecture to train the model and need to understand about the training effort and the output for a samll datasets.
      starting from this architecture I'm trying to improve the output with different GAN architectures to get an idea of bottel-necks of training a GAN from the scratch.
   
  2. Logo generation using a GAN from the scratch.
      This is to experiment how to create your own GAN for new dataset from the step of collecting data.
